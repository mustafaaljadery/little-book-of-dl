# 6. Prediction

A direct application of deep models to image processing is to recover from degradation by utilizing the redundancy in the statistical structure of images.

**Denoising Autoencoder** - A type of neural networkk that is designed to remove noise or unwanted variations from data.

Such a model is trained by collecting a large number of clean samples paired with their degraded in puts.

**Image Classification** - The simplest strategy for extracting semantics from an image and consists of predictin g a class from a finite, predefined number of classes, given an input image.

**Object Detection** - Given an input image, predict the classes and positions of objects of interest.
- This is expensive because putting boxes around a bunch of data is human time costly.

**Single Shot Detector** - Efficiently detect and localize objects within images, particularly in real-time scenarios.

**Semantic Segmentation** - Predicting, for each piel, the class of the object to which it belongs.

**Speech Recognition** - Casting it words to a sequence-to-sequence translation and then solving it with a standard attention based transformer.
- Spectogram: A away to visualize the different frequency components of a signal over time.

**Text-image Representation** - Consistent image and text representations are mapped to be the same feature vector.

**Contrastive Loss** - A loss function popular in self-supervised learning where the model learns to differentiate between similar and dissimilar data points.

**Zero-Shot Prediction** - Ability to make accurate predictions for classes or tasks it has never been directly trained on.

**Markovian** - If a system's future behavior depends only on its current state and is independent of its past history beyond that state.

**Markovian Decision Process** - Mathematical framework used to model decision making in situtations where outcomes are uncertain and the environment is influenced by stochastic (random) events.

**Deep Q Network** - RL algorithm that combines deep NN with the Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal strategies for decision-making in environments with discrete actions.
