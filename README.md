# The Little Book of Deep Learning

Clearly explained notes of everything in The Little Book of Deep Learning. [Here](https://fleuret.org/public/lbdl.pdf) is the whole book.

I do this becasue first principles are what matter. If you understand the first principles you are good. I'm refreshing my understanding by explaining everything as simply as possible.

## Introduction 

**Artifical Neural Networks** - Computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They detect patterns and make predictions.

**Deep Learning** - A subset of ML that focuses on using ANNs with multiple layers.
